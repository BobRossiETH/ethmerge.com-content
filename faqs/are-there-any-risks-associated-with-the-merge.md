There are always risks when making a large change to a protocol that is securing hundreds of billions of dollars of assets. The merge has been describe as "Trying to replace the engine of an airplane while you are flying." Thankfully, the beacon chain has been running for several months now without issues. There are 4 unique client implmentations, so if one has a bug users can always switch to another, and before launching on mainnet, the code used will be exhaustively checked, tested, and checked again.
