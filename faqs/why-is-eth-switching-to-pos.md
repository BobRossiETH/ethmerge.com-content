Ethereum in its current state is using [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EUAcxhuoU4) to ensure consensus amongst the thousands of nodes of the network. While proof-of-work (PoW) is reliable and secure it is also _extremely_ energy intensive. To produce each block on the network participants are required to use powerful and energy-hungry GPUs to solve a complex mathematical problem.

Alternatively, [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psKDXvXdr7k) guarantees the security of the network in a different way. proof-of-stake (PoS) allows any node operator staking 32 ETH to propose blocks. Should a malicious actor try to temper with the underlying protocol by proposing bad block their funds are slashed â€” meaning they lose a portion of their staked ETH. A failed attack on a proof-of-stake (PoS) network would be equivalent to a failed attack on a proof-of-work (PoW) network causing the attacker's hardware to catch on fire and be destroyed.

Proof-of-stake (PoS) does not require the same energy-intensive hardware as proof-of-work (PoW). Any relatively recent consumer hardware should be capable of running the software required to operate a 32 ETH staking node. Most estimates put the expected energy savings from the switch to proof-of-stake (PoS) to be around 99%.
