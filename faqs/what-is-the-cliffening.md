The Cliffening is the community name given to the large drop in ETH issuance that will occur once Ethereum upgrades to Proof of Stake (PoS). “The Cliffening” is a play on the phrase “The Halvening”. While BTC halves its issuance rate every 4 years, ETH is due to see its issuance rate get cut down by roughly 90% at the time of the merge – that's equivalent to 3 BTC halvenings happening at once. ETH will do in an instant what will take BTC 12 years to achieve.

Under the current Proof of Work (PoW) model, Ethereum issues roughly [13,500 ETH per day](https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward) and yearly about 4.3% of the total supply. However, the PoS model determines issuance based on how much ETH is being staked. Under PoS, we will likely see [between a 0.3% to 0.4% issuance rate](https://i.imgur.com/8u5zY4l.jpg) when the merge goes live.

For comparison, Bitcoin currently issues 900 BTC per day and yearly about 1.7% of the total supply. The next two halvenings will take BTC's issuance down to approximately 0.8% in 2024 and 0.4% in 2028. With Ethereum’s expected post-merge issuance of 0.3% to 0.4%, it would not be until 2028 for Bitcoin to be within range of Ethereum. However, the base fee burn of EIP-1559 combined with "The Cliffening" is expected to make Ethereum deflationary during periods of high user activity.
