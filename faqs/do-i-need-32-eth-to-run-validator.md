32 ETH is a lot of money, but it was an amount chosen with good reason.  It is high enough to keep network participants honest due to the risk of lost ETH if they behave dishonestly, but it is also low enough so that a sufficient number of validators can exist on the network which allows it to maintain a strong security posture.  Although technically you do need 32 ETH to activate and run a validator, a service such as [RocketPool](https://www.rocketpool.net/) allows someone with greater than 16 ETH to be matched with 16 ETH deposited to the RocketPool smart contract by other stakers (who typically also have less than 32 ETH, but don't want to run a validator) so that you may run a validator without owning 32 ETH yourself.
