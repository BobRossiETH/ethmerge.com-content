No. The merge is limited in scope to changing the consensus mechanism. In practice it should not have any effect on the current user experience of Ethereum today. The other half of Eth2, sharding, is what will help improve gas prices. Currently sharding is considered to be a slightly lower priority by most of the Ethereum community.
