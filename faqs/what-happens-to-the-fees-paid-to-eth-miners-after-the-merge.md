[EIP 1559](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq) will have been activated on Ethereum before the merge, and so by the time the merge happens the bulk of Ethereum transaction fees will already have been burned for months. The remaining fees that are not burned post-EIP-1559 (called "tips" or "priority fees") will simply be paid to the block proposer of the proof-of-stake block instead of a proof-of-work miner.
