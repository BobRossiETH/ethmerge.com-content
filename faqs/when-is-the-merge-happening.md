As of time of writing there's no definitive date for the merge.

The Ethereum (1.x / PoW) chain will undergo at least 2 hard forks named [Berlin and London](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd-update-001) before any subtantial move towards PoS.

The Ethereum (2.0 / PoS) chain will undergo its first hard fork (Codenamed Altair) in June 2021.

There's an [Ethereum virtual scaling Hackaton](https://scaling.ethglobal.co) where the ETH1->ETH2 Merge is one of the [projects](https://rayonism.io/) being worked on scheduled Between April 16th and May 14th 2021.

Depending on the result of the prototypes being built a the Hackaton and the first PoS Hard fork, a [decision will be made](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd-update-001) in June 2021 if the ETH1 "Shanghai" hard fork will proceed with ETH1 EIP or if the Merge is prioritized.
