No! All ETH on the Ethereum network under the current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus engine
will be unaffected by the switch to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus engine once "The Merge" occurs.
Users will experience no change in their day-to-day experience using Ethereum â€” all changes related to "The Merge" are "under the hood" and related to the consensus mechanism that secures the network.
