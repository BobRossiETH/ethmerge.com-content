See [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) for in depth details on how to contribute.

If you're a dapp developer: Consider deploying your dapp on on the merge testnet during the [ETHGlobal Scaling Ethereum hackathon](https://scaling.ethglobal.co/) (April 16 - May 14). The more the merrier!

If you're a L2 developer planning to leverage sharded data or a protocol developer who would like to help with the merge process: introduce yourself in the [ETH R&D discord](https://discord.gg/BGuQfYwmVD).

If you're a user: Be on the lookout for dapps that deploy on the upcoming testnet. Help your favorite developers kick the tires and shake out bugs.
