See https://rayonism.io/ on how to contribute. If your a dapp developer then consider deploying your dapp on on the merge testnet during the ethglobal hackathon (April 16 - May 14). If your a rollup project would like to see a glimpse of the future? Then make use of sharded data on the merge testnet.
If your a user then be on the lookout for dapps that deploy on the upcoming testnet.
