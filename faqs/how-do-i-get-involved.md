See https://rayonism.io/ on how to contribute. If your a dapp developer then consider deploying your dapp on on the merge testnet during the ethglobal hackathon (April 16 - May 14). If your a rollup project would like to see a glimpse of the future? Then make use of sharded data on the merge testnet.
If your a user then be on the lookout for dapps that deploy on the upcoming testnet. If your a protocol developer and would like to help with the merge process then I suggest asking in the Eth R&D discord.
