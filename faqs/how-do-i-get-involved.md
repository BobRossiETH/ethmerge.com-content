See [Rayonism](https://rayonism.io/) on how to contribute.

If you're a dapp developer then consider deploying you're dapp on on the merge testnet during the ETHGlobal hackathon (April 16 - May 14).

If you're a L2 developer planning to use shard data then contact the ETH2 developers or ask in the [ETH R&D discord](https://discord.gg/BGuQfYwmVD).

If you're a user then be on the lookout for dapps that deploy on the upcoming testnet. 

If your a protocol developer and would like to help with the merge process then I suggest asking in the [ETH R&D discord](https://discord.gg/BGuQfYwmVD).
