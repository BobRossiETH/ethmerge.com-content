No â€” there is only one Ethereum and the entire network will switch to the new proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus engine.
When "The Merge" occurs the entire Ethereum proof-of-work (PoW) chain _becomes_ the Ethereum PoS chain.

If any nodes were to continue mining a PoW version of Ethereum the would be on their own minority fork and the economic value of their block rewards would be far below their cost of operation. Because miners are incentivized to operate at a profit it is expect that all PoW participants will immediately begin to mine with their hardware on other non-Ethereum PoW blockchains.
